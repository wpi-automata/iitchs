    The robustness value measures whether there are enough agents to satisfy the

    robustness value indicates there are more than enough required agents to
    satisfy the formula. A negative robustness value indicates that there
    are not enough required agents to satisfy the formula.

    This function computes an upper bound on the robustness value for a given
    transition system (TS), set of agents, and CaTL formula. This upper bound can
    be used as a "sanity check" to test if the formula is infeasible for the
    given TS and set of agents. If the upper bound is negative, then the
    problem is infeasible. If the upper bound is positive, then it is *possible*
    that the problem is feasible.

    If the upper bound is negative, there is no point in solving the associated
    MILP. The problem is infeasible.
